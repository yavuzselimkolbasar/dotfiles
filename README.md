# My NixOS/Hyprland Configs

I'm new to NixOS and I'm sharing my personal configuration files for my desktop and laptop setups.  

## What’s Included

- Desktop and laptop configurations  
- KDE Plasma setup  
- Virtualization tools (QEMU, libvirt, Looking Glass)
- GPU passtrough
- Cool looking Hyprland config with the Dank Linux Shell

## Notes

- These configs are my personal setup and may require adjustments for other hardware.  
- I use `$user` placeholders for my username.  

## Future Plans
